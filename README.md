# Zubeda Hassan — Week 3 Command Line and Git Workflow

This Week 3 project carries forward my Week 2 portfolio and adds a command-line and Git workflow. The portfolio pages have been adapted for a repository subpath, and the project includes a setup script, a terminal log, and daily challenge guides.

## Project Description

The portfolio introduces me, the programming topics I am learning, and the projects I am building. This week’s work also practices file operations, shell scripting, meaningful commits, branches, merges, and collaboration through pull requests.

## Live Demo

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Git and GitHub
- Bash
- Markdown

## Features

- Four connected pages: Home, About, Projects, and Contact
- Responsive layout with keyboard focus styles and labeled form fields
- A profile photo and an introduction to my interests and current learning
- Project cards that describe completed and in-progress learning work
- Project setup script, `.gitignore`, and daily challenge guides

The contact form is a front-end example; it does not send messages to a server.

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in a browser. To create a separate starter project in Git Bash, run:

```bash
bash new-project.sh my-project
```

## Lessons Learned

Moving a site to a repository-specific GitHub Pages URL means its links should be relative to the project, rather than pointing to the domain root. I also corrected the stylesheet link so it matches the actual file name. In Git, small commits and short-lived feature branches make changes easier to understand and review.

## Challenges Faced

The original Week 2 pages used root-relative navigation links and referenced `style.css`, while the stylesheet file is named `styles.css`. I updated the Week 3 copy to use repository-relative links and the matching stylesheet name, leaving the marked Week 2 repository untouched. Git Bash could not start in the workspace because Windows denied creation of the MSYS named object, so the non-Git terminal exercises remain unrun and are marked in `terminal-log.md`.
